# NvidiaApi

Nvidia Api is a reversal of the latest nvml.dll.

Nvml.dll allows developers to query Devicename, UUID and similar values.
Most people that try to spoof these values just delete the dll from their system.

This project shows that it's possible to retrieve these values even without the dll.

Remarks:
This was developed for version 511.79. Future or older versions might differ!
